   bio: "Shireesh heads technology at eLitmus. He is generally curious about things, especially technology.
      His curiosity almost cost him his first job when he hacked into a customer's system to gain unauthorized internet 
      access (mid '90s). He was lucky, his employer saw this as a potential rather than a threat."

   bio: "Carry (Officially: Roshan Cariappa) started his career with eLitmus back in 2009. We wouldn't know for sure how much he enjoyed life as an insider, but from his recent blog posts, it appears, he cherishes his time at eLitmus. Carry has tried his hands at things you won't even imagine... If you walk into a Bangalore restaurant and see a distinct looking,  tastefully done menu card, chances are it is his handy work. Carry is a full time Startup guy. He is passionate about music and once considered making music his career. He even had a band called JumpOnCarry. He is a great writer too... as you might have already realised reading this article.
